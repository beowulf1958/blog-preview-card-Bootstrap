## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass /scss
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap

### What I learned

The point of this exercise was to complete a challenge using Bootstrap. I followed along with a YouTube video of a guy making a cake webpage in Bootstrap, and just adapted it to the corrent project. The only thing I had to figure out was the avatar section.

I also wanted to continue using Sass, and was able to reuse Sass file from a prebious challenge, so I saved a bit of time there. Overall, prototyping in Bootstrap make the process significantly faster.

```html
<div class="card-footer d-flex p-2 gap-2 mb-3">
  <div class="avatar mb-2">
    <img
      src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp"
      alt="avatar of Greg Hooper"
      width="30"
    />
  </div>
  <span class="align-middle bold">Greg Hooper</span>
</div>
```

### Continued development

Could not get the custom cursor to work. Will continue to research.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvlD_OPszuc) - This helped me by giving me a template for working with Bootstrap. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
